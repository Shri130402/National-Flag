    <h4>ALSO CALLED BHARAT</h4><hr>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/India_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg/375px-India_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg.png" height="180" width="200"
	<p>India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bharat), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in the world. 
        Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. 
        In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia. 
        The nation's capital city is New Delhi. In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western coasts. 
        Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains, eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam. 
        In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions, a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan
        In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture. </p><br>

    <h4><u>HISTORY</u></h4>

    <p>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.
        The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago. After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan, Pakistan.
        These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation, the first urban culture in South Asia, which flourished during 2500-1900 BCE in what is now Pakistan and western India.
        Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.</p>

       <h4><u>GEOGRAPHY</u></h4>
       <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Tungabhadra_River_and_Coracle_Boats.JPG/312px-Tungabhadra_River_and_Coracle_Boats.JPG" height="180" width="180"
    <p>India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate.
        India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.
        Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate. These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.
        Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
         The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range, which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction. To the west lies the Thar Desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis.</p>

         <h4><u>CULTURE</u></h4>
         <img src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/indian-culture-easy-to-edit-vector-illustration-map-formed-different-cultural-sybmol-30592645.jpg" height="240" width="180"
         <p>Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years. During the Vedic period (c.1700 BCE c.500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dh치rma, k치rma, y칩ga, and mok攷므, were established. 
            India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions.
            The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads,the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement, and by Buddhist philosophy. 
            Most of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and Amaravati, or is rock-cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, Karla and Ellora. 
            Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later. In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities. 
            Gupta art, at its peak c.-300 CE - c.-500 CE, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves. Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after c.-800 CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues. 
            But in the South, under the Pallava and Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja.</p>

        <h4><u>ECONOMY</u></h4>

        <p>According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2021 was nominally worth $3.04 trillion; it is the fifth-largest economy by market exchange rates, and is around $10.219 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).
            With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011-2012, India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies.
            However, the country ranks 139th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 118th in GDP per capita at PPP. Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. 
            Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world.
            An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy; since then it has moved slowly towards a free-market system by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.
            India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995. Averaging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior to 2007, India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century.

        <p>In India, it rains only during a specific time of the year. The season as well as the phenomenon that causes it is called the monsoon. There are two of them, the Southwest and the Northeast, both named after the directions the winds come from. 
            The Southwest monsoon is the more important one, as it causes rains over most parts of the country, and is the crucial variable that decides how the crops will do. It lasts from June to September. 
            The Southwest monsoon hits the west coast the most, as crossing the Western Ghats and reaching the rest of India is an uphill task for the winds. 
            The western coastline is therefore much greener than the interior. The Northeast monsoon hits the east coast between October and February, mostly in the form of occasional cyclones that cause much devastation every year. 
            The only region that gets rains from both monsoons is North-Eastern India, which consequently experiences the highest rainfall in the world.</p>
