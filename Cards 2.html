	<h2><u> ABOUT SRI LANKA: </u></h2>

    <h4>ALSO CALLED LANKA OF RAAVAN</h4><hr>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Emblem_of_Sri_Lanka.svg/128px-Emblem_of_Sri_Lanka.svg.png"  height="190" width="180"
	<p>Sri Lanka  romanized: Śrī Laṅkā  Tamil: இலங்கை, romanized: Ilaṅkai (IPA: [ilaŋɡaj])), formerly known as Ceylon and officially the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, is an island country in South Asia. 
        It lies in the Indian Ocean, southwest of the Bay of Bengal, and southeast of the Arabian Sea; it is separated from the Indian subcontinent by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait. 
        Sri Lanka shares a maritime border with India and the Maldives. 
        Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is its legislative capital, and Colombo is its largest city and financial centre.
        Sri Lanka has a population of around 22 million (2020) and is a multinational state, home to diverse cultures, languages, and ethnicities. 
        The Sinhalese are the majority of the nation's population. The Tamils, who are a large minority group, have also played an influential role in the island's history.
         Other long established groups include the Moors, the Burghers, the Malays, the Chinese, and the indigenous Vedda.</p>

    <h4><u>HISTORY</u></h4>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Buda_de_Avukana_-_01.jpg/360px-Buda_de_Avukana_-_01.jpg" height="200" width="200"
    <p>The pre-history of Sri Lanka goes back 125,000 years and possibly even as far back as 500,000 years.
        The era spans the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, and early Iron Ages. Among the Paleolithic human settlements discovered in Sri Lanka, Pahiyangala (37,000 BP), named after the Chinese traveller monk Faxian; Batadombalena (28,500 BP); and Belilena (12,000 BP) are the most important. 
        In these caves, archaeologists have found the remains of anatomically modern humans which they have named Balangoda Man, and other evidence suggesting that they may have engaged in agriculture and kept domestic dogs for driving game.
        The earliest inhabitants of Sri Lanka were probably ancestors of the Vedda people, an indigenous people numbering approximately 2,500 living in modern-day Sri Lanka.
        During the protohistoric period (1000-500 BCE) Sri Lanka was culturally united with southern India, and shared the same megalithic burials, pottery, iron technology, farming techniques and megalithic graffiti.
         This cultural complex spread from southern India along with Dravidian clans such as the Velir, prior to the migration of Prakrit speakers. </p>

    <p>Sri Lanka is a pear-shaped Island nation in South Asia, lying on the Indian Plate, a major tectonic plate that was formerly part of the Indo-Australian Plate.
        It is in the Indian Ocean southwest of the Bay of Bengal, between latitudes 5° and 10° N, and longitudes 79° and 82° E. Sri Lanka is separated from the mainland portion of the Indian subcontinent by the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Strait. 
        According to Hindu mythology, a land bridge existed between the Indian mainland and Sri Lanka. It now amounts to only a chain of limestone shoals remaining above sea level. Legends claim that it was passable on foot up to 1480 CE, until cyclones deepened the channel. 
        Portions are still as shallow as 1 metre (3 ft), hindering navigation. The island consists mostly of flat to rolling coastal plains, with mountains rising only in the south-central part. 
        The highest point is Pidurutalagala, reaching 2,524 metres (8,281 ft) above sea level.

         <h4><u>CULTURE</u></h4>

         <p>The culture of Sri Lanka is influenced primarily by Buddhism and Hinduism. Sri Lanka is the home to two main traditional cultures: the Sinhalese (centred in Kandy and Anuradhapura) and the Tamil (centred in Jaffna). 
            Tamils co-existed with the Sinhalese people since then, and the early mixing rendered the two ethnic groups almost physically indistinguishable. 
            Ancient Sri Lanka is marked for its genius in hydraulic engineering and architecture. 
            The British colonial culture has also influenced the locals. 
            In April, Sri Lankans celebrate the Buddhist and Hindu new year festivals.
            Dishes include rice and curry, pittu, kiribath, wholemeal roti, string hoppers, wattalapam (a rich pudding of Malay origin made with coconut milk, jaggery, cashews, eggs, and spices including cinnamon and nutmeg), kottu, and appam.
            The rich cultural traditions shared by all Sri Lankan cultures is the basis of the country's long life expectancy, advanced health standards and high literacy rate.</p>

        <h4><u>ECONOMY</u></h4>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Colombo_sunset_skyline_Jul_2016.jpg/525px-Colombo_sunset_skyline_Jul_2016.jpg" height="180" width="200"
        <p>According to the International Monetary Fund, Sri Lanka's GDP in terms of purchasing power parity is the second highest in the South Asian region in terms of per capita income. 
            In the 19th and 20th centuries, Sri Lanka became a plantation economy famous for its production and export of cinnamon, rubber, and Ceylon tea, which remains a trademark national export.
            The development of modern ports under British rule raised the strategic importance of the island as a centre of trade. From 1948 to 1977, socialism strongly influenced the government's economic policies. 
            Colonial plantations were dismantled, industries were nationalised, and a welfare state established.
            Services accounted for 58.2% of Sri Lanka's economy in 2019 up from 54.6% in 2010, industry 27.4% up from 26.4% a decade earlier and agriculture 7.4%. 
            In 1977, the free market economy was introduced to the country, incorporating privatisation, deregulation, and the promotion of private enterprise.</p>

        <h4><u>CLIMATE</u></h4>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Sri_Paada1.JPG/330px-Sri_Paada1.JPG" height="190" width="200"
        <p>The climate is tropical and warm because of moderating effects of ocean winds. Mean temperatures range from 17 °C (62.6 °F) in the central highlands, where frost may occur for several days in the winter, to a maximum of 33 °C (91.4 °F) in low-altitude areas. 
            Average yearly temperatures range from 28 °C (82.4 °F) to nearly 31 °C (87.8 °F). 
            Day and night temperatures may vary by 14 °C (57.2 °F) to 18 °C (64.4 °F).[173]
            The rainfall pattern is influenced by monsoon winds from the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal. 
            The "wet zone" and some of the windward slopes of the central highlands receive up to 2,500 millimetres (98.4 in) of rain each year, but the leeward slopes in the east and northeast receive little rain. 
            Most of the east, southeast, and northern parts of Sri Lanka comprise the "dry zone", which receives between 1,200 and 1,900 mm (47 and 75 in) of rain annually.</p>
