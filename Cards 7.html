	<p>Zimbabwe officially the Republic of Zimbabwe, is a landlocked country located in Southeast Africa, between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers, bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the south-west, Zambia to the north, and Mozambique to the east. 
        The capital and largest city is Harare. The second largest city is Bulawayo. A country of roughly 15 million people, Zimbabwe has 16 official languages, with English, Shona, and Ndebele the most common. 
        It was once referred to by Samora Machel as the "Jewel of Africa" for its great prosperity during the early years of Robert Mugabe.
        Beginning in the 9th century, during its late Iron Age, the Bantu people (who would become the ethnic Shona) built the city-state of Great Zimbabwe which became one of the major African trade centres by the 11th century, controlling the gold, ivory and copper trades with the Swahili coast, which were connected to Arab and Indian states. 
        By the mid 15th century, the city-state had been abandoned.
        Emmerson Mnangagwa has since served as Zimbabwe's president. 
        The British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes demarcated the Rhodesia region in 1890 when they conquered Mashonaland and later in 1893 Matabeleland after a fierce resistance by Matabele people known as the First Matabele War. 
        Company rule ended in 1923 with the establishment of Southern Rhodesia as a self-governing British colony.
        Zimbabwe is a member of the United Nations, the Southern African Development Community, the African Union, and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa.  
        From there, the Kingdom of Zimbabwe was established, followed by the Rozvi and Mutapa empires. </p>

    <h4><u>HISTORY</u></h4>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Hondius_Bohdan_Khmelnytsky.jpg/255px-Hondius_Bohdan_Khmelnytsky.jpg" alt="Img not found" height="220" width="200">
    <p>Archaeological records date human settlement of present-day Zimbabwe to at least 500,000 years ago. 
        The earliest known inhabitants were probably San people, who left behind arrowheads and cave paintings. 
        The first Bantu-speaking farmers arrived during the Bantu expansion around 2,000 years ago.
        By 1220, the Kingdom of Zimbabwe eclipsed Mapungubwe. This Shona state further refined and expanded upon Mapungubwe's stone architecture, which survives to this day at the ruins of the kingdom's capital of Great Zimbabwe
        Societies speaking proto-Shona languages first emerged in the middle Limpopo River valley in the 9th century before moving on to the Zimbabwean highlands.
        Mzilikazi then organised his society into a military system with regimental kraals, similar to those of Shaka, which was stable enough to repel further Boer incursions. 
        The Zimbabwean plateau became the centre of subsequent Shona states, beginning around the 10th century. Around the early 10th century, trade developed with Arab merchants on the Indian Ocean coast, helping to develop the Kingdom of Mapungubwe in the 11th century. 
        This was the precursor to the Shona civilisations that dominated the region during the 13th to 15th centuries, evidenced by ruins at Great Zimbabwe, near Masvingo, and by other smaller sites. The main archaeological site used a unique dry stone architecture. The Kingdom of Mapungubwe was the first in a series of trading states which had developed in Zimbabwe by the time the first European explorers arrived from Portugal. 
        These states traded gold, ivory, and copper for cloth and glass.</p>

       <h4><u>GEOGRAPHY</u></h4>
       <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Topographic_map_of_Ukraine_%28with_borders_and_towns%29.svg/330px-Topographic_map_of_Ukraine_%28with_borders_and_towns%29.svg.png" alt="Img not found" height="220" width="200">
    <p>Zimbabwe is a landlocked country in southern Africa, lying between latitudes 15째 and 23째S, and longitudes 25째 and 34째E. It is bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the west and southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique to the east and northeast. 
        Its northwest corner is roughly 150 meters from Namibia, nearly forming a four-nation quadripoint. Most of the country is elevated, consisting of a central plateau (high veld) stretching from the southwest northwards with altitudes between 1,000 and 1,600 m. 
        The country's extreme east is mountainous, this area being known as the Eastern Highlands, with Mount Nyangani as the highest point at 2,592 m.
        Over geological time Zimbabwe has experienced two major post-Gondwana erosion cycles (known as African and post-African), and a very subordinate Plio-Pleistocene cycle.
        Zimbabwe has a subtropical climate with many local variations. The southern areas are known for their heat and aridity, while parts of the central plateau receive frost in winter.
        The Zambezi valley is known for its extreme heat, and the Eastern Highlands usually experience cool temperatures and the highest rainfall in the country.
        The highlands are known for their natural environment, with tourist destinations such as Nyanga, Troutbeck, Chimanimani, Vumba and Chirinda Forest at Mount Selinda. 
        About 20% of the country consists of low-lying areas, under 900m. Victoria Falls, one of the world's largest and most spectacular waterfalls, is located in the country's extreme northwest and is part of the Zambezi river.</p>

         <h4><u>CULTURE</u></h4>
         <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Pysanky2011.JPG/330px-Pysanky2011.JPG" alt="Img not found" height="230" width="200" >
         <p>Traditional arts in Zimbabwe include pottery, basketry, textiles, jewellery and carving. 
            Among the distinctive qualities are symmetrically patterned woven baskets and stools carved out of a single piece of wood. Shona sculpture, which has a long cultural history, began evolving into its modern form in the mid 20th century and gained increasing international popularity. 
            Most subjects of carved figures of stylised birds and human figures among others are made with sedimentary rock such as soapstone, as well as harder igneous rocks such as serpentine and the rare stone verdite. 
            Shona sculpture has survived through the ages, and the modern style is a fusion of African folklore with European influences. 
            World-renowned Zimbabwean sculptors include Nicholas, Nesbert and Anderson Mukomberanwa, Tapfuma Gutsa, Henry Munyaradzi and Locardia Ndandarika.
            Internationally, Zimbabwean sculptors have managed to influence a new generation of artists, particularly black Americans, through lengthy apprenticeships with master sculptors in Zimbabwe.
            Zimbabwean artefacts can be found in countries like Singapore, China and Canada. e.g. Dominic Benhura's statue in the Singapore Botanic Gardens.
            Contemporary artists like New York sculptor M. Scott Johnson and California sculptor Russel Albans have learned to fuse both African and Afro-diasporic aesthetics.
            A recurring theme in Zimbabwean art is the metamorphosis of man into beast. </p>

        <h4><u>ECONOMY</u></h4>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/%D0%97%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%86%D1%8F.jpg/330px-%D0%97%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%86%D1%8F.jpg" alt="Img not found" height="230" width="200">
        <p> The main foreign exports of Zimbabwe are minerals, gold, and agriculture. Zimbabwe is the largest trading partner of South Africa on the continent. 
            Taxes and tariffs are high for private enterprises, while state enterprises are strongly subsidised. State regulation is costly to companies; starting or closing a business is slow and expensive. 
            Tourism also plays a key role in the economy but has been failing in recent years. 
            The Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force released a report in June 2007, estimating that 60% of Zimbabwe's wildlife had died since 2000 as a result of poaching and deforestation. 
            The report warns that the loss of life combined with widespread deforestation is potentially disastrous for the tourism industry.
             The information and communications technology sector has been growing at a fast pace. 
            A report by the mobile internet browser company Opera in 2011 ranked Zimbabwe as Africa's fastest growing market.
            A market in Mbare, Harare Since January 2002, the government has had its lines of credit at international financial institutions frozen, through U.S. legislation called the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 (ZDERA). 
            Section 4C instructs the secretary of the treasury to direct international financial institutions to veto the extension of loans and credit to the Zimbabwean government. 
            The Zimbabwean government and its supporters attest that it was Western policies to avenge the expulsion of their kin that sabotaged the economy.

        <h4><u>CLIMATE</u></h4>

        <p>Most of the United Kingdom has a temperate climate, with generally cool temperatures and plentiful rainfall all year round. 
            The temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below 0 째C (32 째F) or rising above 30 째C (86 째F).
            United Kingdom is ranked 4 out of 180 countries in the Environmental Performance Index. 
            A law has been passed that UK greenhouse gas emissions will be net zero by 2050.
             Some parts, away from the coast, of upland England, Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland, experience a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc). 
            Higher elevations in Scotland experience a continental subarctic climate (Dfc) and the mountains experience a tundra climate (ET). The prevailing wind is from the southwest and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean, although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind since the majority of the rain falls over the western regions the eastern parts are therefore the driest. 
            Atlantic currents, warmed by the Gulf Stream, bring mild winters; especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground. 
            Summers are warmest in the southeast of England and coolest in the north. Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground, and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills. </p>
