    <h4>ALSO CALLED UK</h4><hr>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/128px-Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="Img not found" height="190" width="200">
	<p>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a country in Europe, off the north-western coast of the continental mainland. 
        It comprises England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The United Kingdom includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands within the British Isles. 
        Northern Ireland shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland; otherwise, the United Kingdom is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, the English Channel, the Celtic Sea and the Irish Sea. 
        The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy.
        The capital and largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with a metropolitan area population of over 14 million.
        The United Kingdom has evolved from a series of annexations, unions and separations of constituent countries over several hundred years. 
        The total area of the United Kingdom is 242,495 square kilometres (93,628 sq mi), with an estimated 2020 population of more than 67 million people </p>

    <h4><u>HISTORY</u></h4>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Stonehenge%2C_Condado_de_Wiltshire%2C_Inglaterra%2C_2014-08-12%2C_DD_18.JPG/330px-Stonehenge%2C_Condado_de_Wiltshire%2C_Inglaterra%2C_2014-08-12%2C_DD_18.JPG" alt="Img not found" height="210" width="200">
    <p>Settlement by anatomically modern humans of what was to become the United Kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30,000 years ago. 
        By the end of the region's prehistoric period, the population is thought to have belonged, in the main, to a culture termed Insular Celtic, comprising Brittonic Britain and Gaelic Ireland.
        The Roman conquest, beginning in 43 AD, and the 400-year rule of southern Britain, was followed by an invasion by Germanic Anglo-Saxon settlers, reducing the Brittonic area mainly to what was to become Wales, Cornwall and, until the latter stages of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, the Hen Ogledd (northern England and parts of southern Scotland).
        Most of the region settled by the Anglo-Saxons became unified as the Kingdom of England in the 10th century.
        The English monarchs, through inheritance of substantial territories in France and claims to the French crown, were also heavily involved in conflicts in France, most notably the Hundred Years War.
        In the mid-17th century, all three kingdoms were involved in a series of connected wars (including the English Civil War) which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy, with the execution of King Charles I.
        Meanwhile, Gaelic-speakers in north-west Britain (with connections to the north-east of Ireland and traditionally supposed to have migrated from there in the 5th century) united with the Picts to create the Kingdom.</p>

       <h4><u>GEOGRAPHY</u></h4>
       <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Keswick_Panorama_-_Oct_2009.jpg/338px-Keswick_Panorama_-_Oct_2009.jpg" alt="Img not found" height="210" width="200">
    <p>The total area of the United Kingdom is approximately 244,820 square kilometres (94,530 sq mi). 
        The country occupies the major part of the British Isles archipelago and includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland and some smaller surrounding islands. 
        It lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea with the southeast coast coming within 22 miles (35 km) of the coast of northern France, from which it is separated by the English Channel. 
        In 1993 10 per cent of the UK was forested, 46 per cent used for pastures and 25 per cent cultivated for agriculture.
        England accounts for just over half (53 per cent) of the total area of the UK, covering 130,395 square kilometres (50,350 sq mi).
        Most of the country consists of lowland terrain,[165] with more upland and some mountainous terrain northwest of the Tees-Exe line; including the Lake District, the Pennines, Exmoor and Dartmoor.
        The United Kingdom lies between latitudes 49째 and 61째 N, and longitudes 9째 W and 2째 E. Northern Ireland shares a 224-mile (360 km) land boundary with the Republic of Ireland.
        The Royal Greenwich Observatory in London was chosen as the defining point of the Prime Meridian in Washington, DC, in 1884, although due to more accurate modern measurement the meridian actually lies 100 metres to the east of the observatory.</p>

         <h4><u>CULTURE</u></h4>
         <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/West_Side_of_Westminster_Abbey%2C_London_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1406999.jpg/255px-West_Side_of_Westminster_Abbey%2C_London_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1406999.jpg" alt="Img not found" height="210" width="200" >
         <p>The culture of the United Kingdom has been influenced by many factors including: the nation's island status; its history as a western liberal democracy and a major power; as well as being a political union of four countries with each preserving elements of distinctive traditions, customs and symbolism. 
            As a result of the British Empire, British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies including Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and the United States; a common culture coined today as the Anglosphere. 
            The substantial cultural influence of the United Kingdom has led it to be described as a "cultural superpower".
            Scotland's contributions include Arthur Conan Doyle (the creator of Sherlock Holmes), Sir Walter Scott, J. M. Barrie, Robert Louis Stevenson and the poet Robert Burns. 
            rish writers, living at a time when all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, include Oscar Wilde, Bram Stoker and George Bernard Shaw.
            "British literature" refers to literature associated with the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.
            A global opinion poll for the BBC saw the United Kingdom ranked the third most positively viewed nation in the world (behind Germany and Canada) in 2013 and 2014.</p>

        <h4><u>ECONOMY</u></h4>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Banco_de_Inglaterra%2C_Londres%2C_Inglaterra%2C_2014-08-11%2C_DD_141.JPG/330px-Banco_de_Inglaterra%2C_Londres%2C_Inglaterra%2C_2014-08-11%2C_DD_141.JPG" alt="Img not found" height="210" width="200">
        <p>The UK has a partially regulated market economy. Based on market exchange rates, the UK is today the fifth-largest economy in the world and the second-largest in Europe after Germany. 
            HM Treasury, led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is responsible for developing and executing the government's public finance policy and economic policy. 
            The Bank of England is the UK's central bank and is responsible for issuing notes and coins in the nation's currency, the pound sterling. Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover their issue. 
            The pound sterling is the world's fourth-largest reserve currency (after the US dollar, euro, and Japanese Yen).
            The UK service sector makes up around 79 per cent of GDP.
            Tourism is very important to the British economy; with over 27 million tourists arriving in 2004, the United Kingdom is ranked as the sixth major tourist destination in the world 
            London is one of the world's largest financial centres, ranking second in the world, behind New York City, in the Global Financial Centres Index in 2020.
            Since 1997 the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, headed by the Governor of the Bank of England, has been responsible for setting interest rates at the level necessary to achieve the overall inflation target for the economy that is set by the Chancellor each year

        <h4><u>CLIMATE</u></h4>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Giant%27s_Causeway_-_Bushmills%2C_Northern_Ireland%2C_UK_-_August_17%2C_2017_09.jpg/252px-Giant%27s_Causeway_-_Bushmills%2C_Northern_Ireland%2C_UK_-_August_17%2C_2017_09.jpg" alt="Img not found" height="210" width="190">
        <p>Most of the United Kingdom has a temperate climate, with generally cool temperatures and plentiful rainfall all year round. 
            The temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below 0 째C (32 째F) or rising above 30 째C (86 째F).
            United Kingdom is ranked 4 out of 180 countries in the Environmental Performance Index. 
            A law has been passed that UK greenhouse gas emissions will be net zero by 2050.
             Some parts, away from the coast, of upland England, Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland, experience a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc). 
            Higher elevations in Scotland experience a continental subarctic climate (Dfc) and the mountains experience a tundra climate (ET).[182] The prevailing wind is from the southwest and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean, although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind since the majority of the rain falls over the western regions the eastern parts are therefore the driest. 
            Atlantic currents, warmed by the Gulf Stream, bring mild winters;[183] especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground. 
            Summers are warmest in the southeast of England and coolest in the north. Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground, and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills. </p>
