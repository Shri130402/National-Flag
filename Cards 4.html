	<h3><u> ABOUT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: </u></h3>
    <h4>ALSO CALLED USA</h4><hr>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/USA_orthographic.svg/330px-USA_orthographic.svg.png" alt="Img not found" height="210" width="200" > 
	<p>The United States of America (U.S.A. or USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America, is a transcontinental country located primarily in North America. It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, nine Minor Outlying Islands, and 326 Indian reservations. 
        It is the third-largest country by both land and total area. The United States shares land borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south. It has maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, Russia, and other nations.
        With a population of over 331 million, it is the third most populous country in the world.
        By 1900, the United States had become the world's largest economy, and the Spanish-American War and World War I established the country as a world power.
        Paleo-aboriginals migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago, and advanced cultures began to appear later on.
        The national capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city and financial center is New York City. </p>

    <h4><u>HISTORY</u></h4>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Mesa_Verde_National_Park_-_Cliff_Palace.jpg/330px-Mesa_Verde_National_Park_-_Cliff_Palace.jpg" height="210" width="190" 
    <p>It is generally accepted that the first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 12,000 years ago; however, some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival.
         The Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000 BC, is believed to represent the first wave of human settlement of the Americas. 
         Over time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly complex, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.
         The city-state of Cahokia is the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in the modern-day United States.
         The Haudenosaunee, located in the southern Great Lakes region, was established at some point between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries. 
         Most prominent along the Atlantic coast were the Algonquian tribes, who practiced hunting and trapping, along with limited farming.
        This was likely the first of three major waves of migration into North America; later waves brought the ancestors of present-day Athabaskans, Aleuts, and Eskimos.</p>

       <h4><u>GEOGRAPHY</u></h4>
       <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Uspaintedrelief.png/330px-Uspaintedrelief.png" alt="Img not found" height="200" width="190">
       <p>The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470 km2). 
        Of this area, 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,940 km2) is contiguous land, composing 83.65% of total U.S. land area. 
        About 15% is occupied by Alaska, a state in northwestern North America, with the remainder in Hawaii, a state and archipelago in the central Pacific, and the five populated but unincorporated insular territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
        Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, and just ahead of Canada.
        The United States is the world's third- or fourth-largest nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and nearly equal to China.
        The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted, and how the total size of the United States is measured.
        The Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado.

         <h4><u>CULTURE</u></h4>

         <p>The United States is home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values, and exerts major cultural influence on a global scale.
             Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors immigrated or were imported as slaves within the past five centuries.
              Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.
              More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl, with immigrants contributing to, and often assimilating into, mainstream American culture.
              Americans have traditionally been characterized by a strong work ethic, competitiveness, and individualism, as well as a unifying belief in an "American creed" emphasizing liberty, equality, private property, democracy.
             Nevertheless, there is a high degree of social inequality related to race and wealth.

        <h4><u>ECONOMY</u></h4>

        <p>According to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) of $22.7 trillion constitutes 24% of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 16% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity (PPP). 
            From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7. 
            The U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions and is the world's foremost reserve currency, backed by its economy, its military, the petrodollar system.
            Americans have the highest average household and employee income among OECD member states. In 2013, they had the sixth-highest median household income, down from fourth-highest in 2010.
            he U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions and is the world's foremost reserve currency, backed by its economy, its military, the petrodollar system and its linked eurodollar.
            The country ranks fifth in the world in nominal GDP per capita and seventh in GDP per capita at PPP. The country has been the world's largest economy since at least 1900.</p>

        <h4><u>CLIMATE</u></h4>

        <p>The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.
        The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska.
         Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.
        States bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South.
        Extreme weather has become more frequent in the U.S., with three times the number of reported heat waves as in the 1960s.
         Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country in the world.
