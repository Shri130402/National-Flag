	<h2><u> ABOUT SOUTH AFRICA: </u></h2>
    <h4>ALSO CALLED RAINBOW NATION</h4><hr>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/21/Coat_of_arms_of_South_Africa.svg/128px-Coat_of_arms_of_South_Africa.svg.png" height="190" width="180"
	<p>South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. 
        It is bounded to the south by 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) of coastline that stretch along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans; to the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe; and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini. 
        It also completely enclaves the country Lesotho.[17] It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World, and the second-most populous country located entirely south of the equator, after Tanzania. South Africa is a biodiversity hotspot, with unique biomes, plant and animal life. 
        With over 60 million people, the country is the world's 23rd-most populous nation and covers an area of 1,221,037 square kilometres (471,445 square miles). 
        South Africa has three capital cities, with the executive, judicial and legislative branches of government based in Pretoria, Bloemfontein, and Cape Town respectively. The largest city is Johannesburg. </p>

    <h4><u>HISTORY</u></h4>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Charles_Bell_-_Jan_van_Riebeeck_se_aankoms_aan_die_Kaap.jpg/330px-Charles_Bell_-_Jan_van_Riebeeck_se_aankoms_aan_die_Kaap.jpg" height="210" width="180"
    <p>South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological and human-fossil sites in the world. Archaeologists have recovered extensive fossil remains from a series of caves in Gauteng Province. 
        The area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has been branded "the Cradle of Humankind". The sites include Sterkfontein, one of the richest sites for hominin fossils in the world, as well as Swartkrans, Gondolin Cave, Kromdraai, Cooper's Cave and Malapa. 
        Raymond Dart identified the first hominin fossil discovered in Africa, the Taung Child (found near Taung) in 1924. 
        Other hominin remains have come from the sites of Makapansgat in Limpopo Province; Cornelia and Florisbad in Free State Province; Border Cave in KwaZulu-Natal Province; Klasies River Caves in Eastern Cape Province; and Pinnacle Point, Elandsfontein and Die Kelders Cave in Western Cape Province.
        These finds suggest that various hominid species existed in South Africa from about three million years ago, starting with Australopithecus africanus, followed by Australopithecus sediba, Homo ergaster, Homo erectus, Homo rhodesiensis, Homo helmei, Homo naledi and modern humans (Homo sapiens). 
        Modern humans have inhabited Southern Africa for at least 170,000 years.
        Various researchers have located pebble tools within the Vaal River valley.</p>

       <h4><u>GEOGRAPHY</u></h4>
       <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/South_Africa_-_Drakensberg_%2816261357780%29.jpg/330px-South_Africa_-_Drakensberg_%2816261357780%29.jpg" height="210" width="190"
       <p>South Africa is in southernmost Africa, with a coastline that stretches more than 2,500 km (1,553 mi) and along two oceans (the South Atlantic and the Indian). 
        At 1,219,912 km2 (471,011 sq mi), South Africa is the 24th-largest country in the world. Excluding the Prince Edward Islands, the country lies between latitudes 22° and 35°S, and longitudes 16° and 33°E. 
        The interior of South Africa consists of a large, in most places almost flat plateau with an altitude of between 1,000 m (3,300 ft) and 2,100 m (6,900 ft), highest in the east and sloping gently downwards towards the west and north.
        This plateau is surrounded by the Great Escarpment whose eastern, and highest, stretch is known as the Drakensberg. Mafadi in the Drakensberg at 3,450 m (11,320 ft) is the highest peak. 
        The KwaZulu-Natal-Lesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the Great Escarpment which reaches an altitude of over 3,000 m (9,800 ft).
        The south and south-western parts of the plateau (at approximately 1,100-1,800 m above sea level) and the adjoining plain below (at approximately 70-800 m above sea level - see map on the right) is known as the Great Karoo, which consists of sparsely populated shrubland. 
        To the north, the Great Karoo fades into the more arid Bushmanland, which eventually becomes the Kalahari Desert in the north-west of the country.</p>

         <h4><u>CULTURE</u></h4>
         <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/San_Rock_Art_-_Cederberg.jpg/330px-San_Rock_Art_-_Cederberg.jpg" height="210" width="190"
         <p>The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. 
            It is among these people that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly urbanised and Westernised, aspects of traditional culture have declined. 
            Members of the middle class, who are predominantly white but whose ranks include growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people, have lifestyles similar in many respects to that of people found in Western Europe, North America and Australasia.
            includes the oldest art objects in the world, which were discovered in a South African cave and dated from roughly 75,000 years ago.
             The scattered tribes of the Khoisan peoples moving into South Africa from around 10,000 BC had their own fluent art styles seen today in a multitude of cave paintings. 
             They were superseded by the Bantu/Nguni peoples with their own vocabularies of art forms. Forms of art evolved in the mines and townships: a dynamic art using everything from plastic strips to bicycle spokes. 
            The Dutch-influenced folk art of the Afrikaner trekboers and the urban white artists, earnestly following changing European traditions from the 1850s onwards, also contributed to this eclectic mix which continues to evolve to this day.

        <h4><u>ECONOMY</u></h4>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Johannesburg_Stock_Exchange.jpg/255px-Johannesburg_Stock_Exchange.jpg" height="210" width="190"
        <p>South Africa has a mixed economy, the second largest in Africa after Nigeria. It also has a relatively high gross domestic product (GDP) per capita compared to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa (US$11,750 at purchasing power parity as of 2012). 
            Despite this, South Africa is still burdened by a relatively high rate of poverty and unemployment and is ranked in the top ten countries in the world for income inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient. In 2015, 71% of net wealth are held by 10% of the population, whereas 60% of the population held only 7% of the net wealth, and the Gini coefficient was 0.63, whereas in 1996 was 0.61.
            Unlike most of the world's poor countries, South Africa does not have a thriving informal economy. Only 15% of South African jobs are in the informal sector, compared with around half in Brazil and India and nearly three-quarters in Indonesia. 
            The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) attributes this difference to South Africa's widespread welfare system. 
            World Bank research shows that South Africa has one of the widest gaps between per capita GDP versus its Human Development Index ranking, with only Botswana showing a larger gap.</p>

        <h4><u>CLIMATE</u></h4>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Namaqualand%2C_Goegap_0035.jpg/330px-Namaqualand%2C_Goegap_0035.jpg" height="190" width="190"
        <p>South Africa has a generally temperate climate because it is surrounded by the Atlantic and Indian Oceans on three sides, because it is located in the climatically milder Southern Hemisphere, and because its average elevation rises steadily toward the north (toward the equator) and further inland. 
            This varied topography and oceanic influence result in a great variety of climatic zones. 
            The climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern Namib in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the border with Mozambique and the Indian Ocean. Winters in South Africa occur between June and August.
            The extreme southwest has a climate similar to that of the Mediterranean with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous fynbos biome of shrubland and thicket.
            The coldest place on mainland South Africa is Buffelsfontein in the Eastern Cape, where a temperature of -20.1 °C (-4.2 °F) was recorded in 2013. 
            The Prince Edward Islands have colder average annual temperatures, but Buffelsfontein has colder extremes. 
            The deep interior of mainland South Africa has the hottest temperatures: a temperature of 51.7 °C (125.06 °F) was recorded in 1948 in the Northern Cape Kalahari near Upington 
            This area produces much of the wine in South Africa.
